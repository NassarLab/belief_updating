[{"feedback_finish_screen":"The study seemed interesting and all of the questions were pretty straightforward. It did seem not to take as long as previously stated but I'm usually able to scan and process information quickly. Some questions did lead me to think about my personal views and beliefs longer than others that I felt I could give an immediate answer. This was a very thought-provoking study."}]
